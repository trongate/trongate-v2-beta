<h1>Hiding The Admin Login URL</h1>

<p>If someone attempts to hack into your admin panel, they will typically target common entry points such as the default admin login URL and the URL that processes post requests from the login form. Knowing your login URL doesn't mean they have succeeded, but it <i>does</i> give them a useful foothold for malicious activity.</p>

<p>Therefore, it's a security best practice to keep your admin login URL secret — ideally impossible to guess — to make it much harder for attackers to gain access.</p>

<p>By default, the admin login URL for Trongate websites is the base URL followed by <strong>trongate_administrators/login</strong>.  For example:</p>

[code]https://example.com/trongate_administrators/login[/code]

<p>Additionally, a shorter URL using the base URL followed by <strong>tg-admin</strong> is also supported.</p> 

[code]https://example.com/tg-admin[/code]

<p>This shorter alias works because of custom routing defined in the <code>custom_routing.php</code> file inside the <code>config</code> directory.</p>


<h2>How To Create A Secret Admin Login URL</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Choose a Secret Word</strong></h3>
<p>Select a word that is difficult to guess but meaningful and easy for the site owner to remember. This can be a made-up word or a combination of words. Avoid spaces or special characters.</p>

<p>For example, if you choose <strong>fantasticola</strong>, your new admin login URL would be:</p>

[code]https://example.com/fantasticola[/code]

<h3 class="mt-3">Step 2: Update Your Custom Routing File</h3>
<p>Next, open the <code>custom_routing.php</code> file inside the <code>config</code> directory. Replace all instances of <code>tg-admin</code> with your secret word.</p>

<p>For example, after modification (using <code>fantasticola</code>) you would have:</p>

[code=php]&lt;?php
$routes = [
  "fantasticola" =&gt; "trongate_administrators/login",
  "fantasticola/submit_login" =&gt; "trongate_administrators/submit_login"
];

define("CUSTOM_ROUTES", $routes);
[/code]

<h3 class="mt-3">Step 3: Declare Your Secret Login Segment</h3>
<p>Finally, open <code>Trongate_administrators.php</code>. If you are using Trongate version 1.3.3031 or higher, around line 12 you will find the following commented line:</p>

[code=php]//private $secret_login_segment = "tg-admin";[/code]

<p>Uncomment this line and replace <code>"tg-admin"</code> with your chosen secret word.  For example:</p>

[code=php]private $secret_login_segment = "fantasticola";[/code]

<h3 class="mt-3">Done!</h3>
<p>Once these steps are complete, the default admin login URL (<code>trongate_administrators/login</code>) will return a 404 error, effectively hiding it. To access the admin panel, users must navigate to your base URL followed by your secret word (e.g., <code>https://example.com/fantasticola</code>).</p>
