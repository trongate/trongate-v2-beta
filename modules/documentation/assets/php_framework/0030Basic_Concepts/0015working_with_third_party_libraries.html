<h1>Working With Third-Party Libraries</h1>

<p>Trongate doesn’t need Composer. It doesn’t need Packagist. It doesn’t need any third-party code to work flawlessly.</p>

<p>But you’re not trapped in 1999 either. Use anything you want — Composer packages, npm libraries, random GitHub repos, whatever. Trongate won’t stop you. It just won’t depend on them.</p>

<h2>Why Trongate Stays Independent</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Runs forever — even if GitHub, Packagist, or the entire internet disappears tomorrow.</li>
    <li>No surprise updates breaking your app at 3 AM.</li>
    <li>No abandoned dependencies turning into security holes.</li>
    <li>You own your codebase. 100%.</li>
</ul>

    <p><strong>Native PHP</strong> is lean by design. Most things you’re tempted to install already have a faster, cleaner solution in pure PHP.</p>

<h2>When to Reach for a Package</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You need battle-tested crypto (e.g. defuse/php-encryption)</li>
    <li>You want Stripe/PayPal SDKs</li>
    <li>You’re building something complex that already has a mature library</li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise? Write it yourself. That's the Native PHP way!</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>Trongate gives you total control: zero dependencies by default, infinite freedom by choice.</strong></p>
