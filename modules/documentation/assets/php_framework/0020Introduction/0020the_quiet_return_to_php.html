<h1 class="text-center mb-0">The Quiet Return to PHP</h1>
<p class="sm mt-0 text-center">by David Connelly, Founder of Trongate</p>

<p class="mt-3">When Trongate first launched, I made my share of mistakes — a desktop app nobody needed, bloated modules, and documentation that wasn’t ready for the world. I own all of it. Those early missteps taught me something invaluable: developers don’t want grandiosity; they want clarity, simplicity, and control.</p>

<p>Then something shifted. PHP 8.2 and beyond delivered the speed, precision, and elegance the language had always promised. Meanwhile, much of the frameworks world marched in the opposite direction — more layers, more “magic,” more ceremony. Developers began to ask the question nobody in the establishment wanted to hear:</p>

<p><i>“Why does ‘Hello World’ need a small library of autoloaders?”</i></p>

<p>The answer turned out to be simple: <strong>it doesn’t.</strong></p>

<p>So we stripped everything back. We kept <i>only</i> what serves the developer. We removed everything that gets in the way. No mystical abstractions. No service containers. No dependency labyrinths. No illusions of simplicity masking deeper complexity. No third-party code.  Just the essentials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One <code>index.php</code> entry point</li>
  <li>One URL → one method</li>
  <li>One database call → one clean, predictable result</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what we call <strong>Native PHP</strong> — code that moves <i>with</i> the language instead of wrestling <i>against</i> it. A philosophy of development where clarity wins, where performance is natural, and where the developer is in full command.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://github.com/trongate/trongate-framework/graphs/contributors">talented contributors from around the world</a> have taken this vision further than I ever could alone. They’ve made Trongate faster, safer, leaner, and truer to its core than v1 ever was. Trongate is no longer a “one man show.” It’s a community of developers who believe that the best code is the simplest code.</p>

<p>And here’s the truth: this isn’t a rebellion. It’s a <strong>homecoming</strong>. A quiet, steady return to the sheer beauty of PHP itself — direct, powerful, and unapologetically efficient.</p>

<p><b>When we launched Trongate v1, we spent a great deal of time pointing out all the things that we <i>don't</i> like.  This time feels different.   This time, we're here to show people what we <i>do</i> like.</b></p>
